# ZeldaMap

Use this program to generate an overworld map for The Legend of Zelda
* It scans a directory for new screenshots to build the map as you play

## Instructions

* Run the program while playing The Legend of Zelda on your favorite NES emulator
* Take screenshots of the overworld to update the map
* Specify save directories in settings.ini (current directory by default)
* Press the 'S' key to save the map (automatically saves on close)

## Notice

The program uses the mini-map in the upper left to determine where in the map to write the screenshot.  It doesn't support dungeons, so it will overwrite sections if you capture screenshots while in a dungeon.
